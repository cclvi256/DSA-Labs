# Data Structures and Algorithms

## A Brief Introduction to This Repository

This repository consists of some of labs and assignments of the HIT Data Structures and Algorithms courses (Autumn, 2023), and some LeetCode problem solutions.

The labs and assignments is coded in C++, and the LeetCode problem solutions will be coded in C++, C#, C, Java, or Python. If I begin to learn new languages, maybe I will code with the newly learn languages as well.

Some of the labs or assignments are complex to be written in one file, for which I used CMake as the buiding tool.

Don't worry, I will create some directories in this repository, or create some new repositories, to illustrate the usage of C++, CMake, etc. in late July or early August, 2024.

If you find out that some of the code are wrong, or you consider it can be optimised, welcome to make [Issues](https://github.com/cclvi256/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-Labs/issues/new) or [Pull Requests](https://github.com/cclvi256/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-Labs/pulls) to this repository!
