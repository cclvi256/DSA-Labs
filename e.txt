If a snakebitten patient stumbled into an Egyptian physician’s office some 2500 years ago, the doctor might have reached for a papyrus scroll describing 34 snakes and their bites in hieratic script used by ancient Egyptians, with advice on how to treat them. This ancient manual is considered one of the world’s first medical texts.

Since the scroll was first translated 60 years ago, researchers have fiercely debated the identities of the serpents it describes. Now, researchers have used an ecological technique called niche modeling to confidently name 10 of these snakes. Today, Egyptian doctors wouldn’t find the scroll very useful: Of the species pinpointed, none still live within Egypt’s modern borders, the team reported earlier this month in Environmental Archaeology. Even so, experts say the tome offers a glimpse into human-animal interactions of the distant past.

“It’s sort of mind-blowing” that ecological modeling could help answer questions about the health of ancient people, says Gerardo Martin, a disease ecologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mérida, who was not involved in the work. “It’s a very creative use of ecological knowledge.”
